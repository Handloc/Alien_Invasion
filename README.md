# Alien Invasion

### General info
This is the project from book `"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes`.
I did not wrote this code by myself and although there was no place for solving problems by myself I've learned something new.
I think this is a pretty good introduction to `pygame` and if in futuere  I will need to look up for solution in specific problems I can always come back here.
